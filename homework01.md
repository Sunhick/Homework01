## Homework 1

1. Define the term essential difficulties as it is used by Brooks. Provide background and context with your answer and at least one example of an essential difficulty.

2. Define the term accidental difficulties as it is used by Brooks. Provide background and context with your answer and at least one example of an accidental difficulty.

3. List and briefly describe the four essential difficulties of developing software systems that Brooks identifies. Provide additional examples of each type of the four essential difficulties.

4. Define what Brooks means by a silver bullet and reconstruct his argument as to why he believes there is no silver bullet for software engineering.

As per Brooks _"**Silver bullet**"_ means a standard process/procedure (like a _Golden hammer_) to address the missed project schedules, over budgets, buggy software etc. Something that can make the cost of producing software as low as the cost of manufacturing hardware. There is no single development in either software technology or management process that will guarantee at least order of one magnitude improvement in productivity, reliability, complexity. 

Although it sounds appealing to look for silver bullet - none exists due to the very nature of software process. Firstly the software development progress is very slow as compared to the computer hardware progress. 

As per Moore's law - 
>"The number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years.".

This means that the hardware is progressing by two-folds every two years.

secondly, the difficulties inherent in the software technology(essence) and those that attend its production ubt that are not inherent(accidents). Essential difficulties include complexity, conformity,  changeability and Invisibility. Accidental difficulties include high-level languages, time-sharing, and unified programming environments.

5. In lecture, software engineering's relationship to computer science was described by analogy by discussing the differences between a chemist (chemistry) and a chemical engineer (chemical engineering). Define software engineering and its relationship to computer science; make use of the chemist vs. chemical engineer analogy when answering this question.

6. In lecture, we discussed the importance of the following concepts to software engineers: abstractions, conversations, specification, translation, and iteration. Define each of these concepts as they are related to software engineering and discuss their importance.
